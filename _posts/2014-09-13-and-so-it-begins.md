We knew there was something peculiar about how the drake and the acolyte were behaving. They didn't seem to be really
trying to set the mill on fire, so we should have expected the ambush, but the spears descending upon us were an
unpleasant surprise. At least it means I shall have further opportunity this night to battle in Talus' name.
